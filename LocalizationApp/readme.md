I have been read some article about making localizable. And i found the right way to add new resources folder

heres how to make value folder with format language :

right click at res foldr -> new -> Android Resource Directory 

[directory name] (no need to fill up, it will automatically named after select language) 
select [resource type] to [value] 

select [local] at [available qualifiers] then tap button [ >> ] on center
then it will show detail chosen qualifier in this case is [local]
it will show list [language] and list [specific region only]
